Looking back at 2023, these are the apps that saved me time and blocked away my day to day distractions. Please note that this email contains affiliated links, which do not incur any additional cost for you.

### App #1: Opal

Opal is a screen time app that enhances the default screen time feature of iOS devices. It provides greater control and customization options for limiting your screen time. They also offer a Chrome extension for the same purpose, although it would be ideal if it were synced and as powerful as the mobile version.

### App #2: Superhuman

I used to fear opening my email inbox because it always seemed endless. Combined with what I learn from the Pillars of Productivity course by Tiago Forte, I now have a structured and effective way to process my emails. Is it worth the price? Well, for me it is because I feel much calmer when I use Superhuman to check my emails.

### App #3: Raycast

I have been using Raycast as a replacement for the MacBook Spotlight feature for over a year now. It is packed with numerous functionalities and shortcuts that save you a few seconds here and there. When you add them up, you are in fact saving hours of time.

### App #4: Notion AI

I use Notion as a "Second Brain" to store external resources and the knowledge I have learned. The recent AI feature called Q&A makes it even faster to search for relevant information in my Notion workspace.

This feature is useful for anything you may have missed while manually searching for or organizing your information. You can simply ask a question like "Find notes on X" to easily retrieve and connect notes and ideas, even from years ago or anything that may have been overlooked.

### Feature of the Week: How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals

Last week, I stumbled upon a TEDx Talk by Stephen Duneier, and it made me more aware of the small decisions I make throughout my day.

We can regain control of our lives by simply paying attention to the little choices we make, like putting down our phones and picking up a book in this very moment.

### Favourite Quote This Week

“If you can’t do great things, do small things in a great way.” Napoleon Hill

Reflecting on what I have achieved in 2023, it can still feel like there's a higher mountain to climb and makes me feel very much behind. But I’m reminded not to downplay my achievements.

Keep doing the small things well, and eventually, those small things can grow into something great in their own way.
