Welcome to my new website! I'm glad to have you here.

As you might expect, this is the first article to kick things off. You can expect a mix of things related to building and managing many startup businesses, as well as my thoughts on things I find interesting. I will also be sharing my work here, like my products, newsletter and my startup businesses.'

You are here earlier than most. I'm still working on the website and will be adding more content in the coming weeks. If you want to be notified when I publish new articles, you can subscribe to my newsletter below.

I'll leave you with this quote from Søren Kierkegaard:

> It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.

See you around, <br>

<!-- Once again, like I tend to do every other year, I've gone and rebuilt my website and blog. It's something I tinker with every now and then to improve how I share my thoughts and ideas, or sometimes just to freshen up the look and feel. This time around, it's less about the design and more about updating how I write and share content online. The hope here is that this would be the last time I would update my website in a significant way. Ideally, this should last a really long time.

## Improving how I write

A few months ago, I started organizing my writing and taking notes using the zettelkasten (German: "slip box") method. Sociologist Johannes F.K. Schmidt once said the process makes “serendipity possible in a systemically and theoretically informed way.” My experience with the process reflected this. Instead of writing long essays on topics I wanted to explore, I wrote shorter, atomic entries around specific ideas and linked them together. It allowed me the flexibility to explore ideas with few constraints. I used [Obsidian](https://pages.github.com/), a networked note-taking app, to tie all my disconnected thoughts together. If I had written about a specific idea once, I reference it wherever I need it in my other notes. A chain of notes can represent and explain big ideas with ease, and in full.
