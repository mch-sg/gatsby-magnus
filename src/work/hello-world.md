Once again, like I tend to do every other year, I've gone and rebuilt my website and blog. It's something I tinker with every now and then to improve how I share my thoughts and ideas, or sometimes just to freshen up the look and feel. This time around, it's less about the design and more about updating how I write and share content online. The hope here is that this would be the last time I would update my website in a significant way. Ideally, this should last a really long time.

## Improving how I write

A few months ago, I started organizing my writing and taking notes using the zettelkasten (German: "slip box") method. Sociologist Johannes F.K. Schmidt once said the process makes “serendipity possible in a systemically and theoretically informed way.” My experience with the process reflected this. Instead of writing long essays on topics I wanted to explore, I wrote shorter, atomic entries around specific ideas and linked them together. It allowed me the flexibility to explore ideas with few constraints. I used Obsidian, a networked note-taking app, to tie all my disconnected thoughts together. If I had written about a specific idea once, I reference it wherever I need it in my other notes. A chain of notes can represent and explain big ideas with ease, and in full.
